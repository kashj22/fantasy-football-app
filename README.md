# fantasy-football-app
An app built using Angular to drag and drop players onto a football pitch to create a team of the week

# Synopsis
I built this fantasy football app whilst interning for Snack Media, a sports digital agency based in London. This was a project the senior developer wanted to work on for some time
as the company run many sports related websites, the most popular one being footballfancast.com which generates almost 4 million visits per month.
The idea was that the writers could have a tool to allow them to select teams when they would do pieces on team of the week, or preferred lineup for the following match.
Readers could then also create their own team and post it in the comments section, thus creating dialogue between football fans.

# Technologies 
This app was built using HTML and CSS along with the CSS pre-processor LESS. AngularJS was used to build the functionality, along with ngSanitize and ngDraggable to allow the players 
on the left hand side to be dragged over the football pitch and dropped in the desired position.

On the left hand side, you can see a list of the premier league players. We can select players either by typing in their name, or by selecting the clubs and/or positions they play in.
Once we have our players, we drag them across the screen and drop them on their preffered position. We are also able to change the formation of the teams as well.

The app is fully responsive. The goal was to make this a desktop and mobile app. With more experience I would like to go back to this project and make improvements. 
I would like to improve the design and make the players names on the left more aesthetic. But overall as a massive football fan I'm proud of what I built.
